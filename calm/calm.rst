Creating Blueprint (MySQL)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this exercise you will explore the basics of Nutanix Calm by building and deploying a Blueprint that installs and configures a single service, MySQL, on a CentOS image.

Creating Blueprint
..................

From **Prism Central > Apps**, select **Blueprints** from the sidebar and click **+ Create Application Blueprint**.

Specify **CalmIntro<INITIALS>** in the **Blueprint Name** field.
Enter a **Description** in the Description field.
Select **Calm** from the **Project** drop down menu and click **Proceed**.

Click **Proceed** to continue.

Click **Credentials >** :fa:`plus-circle` and fill out the following fields then click **Save**:

- **Credential Name** - CENTOS
- **Username** - root
- **Secret** - Password
- **Password** - nutanix/4u

Click **Back**.

.. note::

  Credentials are unique to each Blueprint.

  Each Blueprint requires a minimum of 1 Credential.

Click **Save** to save your Blueprint.

Setting Variables
.................

Variables allow extensibility of Blueprints, meaning a single Blueprint can be used for multiple purposes and environments depending on the configuration of its variables. Variables can either be static values saved as part of the Blueprint or they can be specified at **Runtime** (when the Blueprint is launched). By default, variables are stored in plaintext and visible in the Configuration Pane. Setting a variable as **Secret** will mask the value and is ideal for variables such as passwords.

Variables can be used in scripts executed against objects using the **@@{variable_name}@@** construct. Calm will expand and replace the variable with the appropriate value before sending to the VM.

In the **Configuration Pane** under **Variable List**, fill out the following fields:

+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+------------+
| **Variable Name**    | **Value**                                            | **Secret** |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+------------+
| Mysql\_user          | root                                                 |            |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+------------+
| Mysql\_password      | nutanix/4u                                           | X          |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+------------+
| Database\_name       | homestead                                            |            |
+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------+------------+
| App\_git\_link       | https://github.com/ideadevice/quickstart-basic.git   |            |

Adding Dependencies
...................

As our application will require the database to be running before the web server starts, our Blueprint requires a dependency to enforce this ordering.

In the **Workspace**, select the **APACHE_PHP** Service and click the **Create Dependency** icon that appears above the Service icon.

Select the **MySQL** Service. This will hold the execution of **APACHE_PHP** installation script until the **MySQL** Service is running.

Click **Save**.

Adding Replicas
...............

Calm makes it simple to add multiple copies of a given Service, which is helpful for scale out workloads such as web servers.

In the **Workspace**, select the **APACHE_PHP** Service.

In the **Configuration Pane**, select the **Service** tab.

Under **Deployment Config**, change the **Max** Number of replicas from 1 to 2.

Creating the Load Balancer
..........................

To take advantage of a scale out web tier our application needs to be able to load balance connections across multiple web server VMs. HAProxy is a free, open source TCP/HTTP load balancer used to distribute workloads across multiple servers. It can be used in small, simple deployments and large web-scale environments such as GitHub, Instagram, and Twitter.

In **Application Overview > Services**, click :fa:`plus-circle`.

Calm Marketplace Part 1
+++++++++++++++++++++++

In this exercise you will learn how to manage Calm Blueprints within the Nutanix Marketplace. As part of the exercise you will publish a pre-configured Blueprint to the local Marketplace, clone the Blueprint from the Marketplace for editing, and launch the application.

Publishing Blueprints from Marketplace Manager
..............................................

By default, Calm comes pre-seeded with validated Blueprints for multiple open source and enterprise applications. Marketplace Manager acts as a staging area for publishing default and user-created Blueprints to your local Marketplace. The Marketplace acts as an application store, providing end users with a catalog of available applications.

From **Prism Central > Apps**, select |mktmgr-icon| **Marketplace Manager** from the sidebar.

Under **Marketplace Blueprints**, select **Mongo**.

Note the Blueprint description contains key information including licensing, hardware requirements, OS, supported platforms, and limitations. Click **Publish**.

.. figure:: images/marketplace_p1_1.png

Wait for the Blueprint **Status** to appear as **Published**.

.. figure:: images/marketplace_p1_2.png

Under **Projects Shared With**, select the **Calm** Project and click **Apply**.

.. figure:: images/marketplace_p1_3.png

.. note::

  If the **Projects Shared With** drop down menu is unavailable, refresh your browser.

Cloning Blueprints from Marketplace
...................................

From **Prism Central > Apps**, select |mkt-icon| **Marketplace** from the sidebar. All Blueprints published in Marketplace Manager are visible here.

.. figure:: images/marketplace_p1_4.png

Select the **Mongo** Blueprint and click **Clone**.

.. note::

  Selecting **Actions Included** for a Blueprint will display the actions that have been implemented for a given Blueprint, such as Create, Start, Stop, Delete, Update, Scale Up, Scale Down, etc.

Takeaways
+++++++++

- Nutanix Calm is a fully integrated component of the Nutanix stack. Easily enabled, highly available out of the box in a Scale Out Prism Central deployment, and takes advantage of non-disruptive One Click upgrades for new features and fixes.
- By using different projects assigned to different clusters and users, administrators can ensure that workloads are deployed the right way each time.  For example, a developer can be a Project Admin for a dev/test project, so they have full control to deploy to their development clusters or to a cloud, while having Read Only access to production projects, allowing them access to logs but no ability to alter production workloads.
- The Blueprint Editor provides a simple UI for modeling potentially complex applications.
- Blueprints are tied to SSP Projects which can be used to enforce quotas and role based access control.
- Having a Blueprint install and configure binaries means no longer creating specific images for individual applications. Instead the application can be modified through changes to the Blueprint or installation script, both of which can be stored in source code repositories.
- Variables allow another dimension of customizing an application without having to edit the underlying Blueprint.
- Application status can be monitored in real time.
- Applications typically span across multiple VMs, each responsible for different services. Calm is capable of automated and orchestrating full applications.
- Dependencies between services can be easily modeled in the Blueprint Editor.
- Users can quickly provision entire application stacks for production or testing for repeatable results without time lost to manual configuration.
- By using pre-seeded Blueprints from the Nutanix Marketplace, users can quickly try out new applications.
- Marketplace Blueprints can be cloned and modified to suit a user's needs. For example, the pre-seeded LAMP Blueprint could be a starting point for a developer looking to swap PHP for a Go application server.
- Marketplace Blueprints can use local disk images or automatically download associated disk images. Users can create their own keys and slipstream them into Blueprints (via cloud-init) to control access.
- Developers can publish Blueprints to the Marketplace for fast and easy consumption by users.
- Blueprints can be launched directly from the Marketplace with no additional configuration from users, delivering a public cloud-like SaaS experience for end users.
- Administrators have control over what Blueprints are published to the Marketplace and which projects have access to published Blueprints.
